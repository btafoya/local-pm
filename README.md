## Installation

### Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/btafoya/local-pm.git
cd local-pm
```

2. Start the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

3. Access the app at http://localhost:3010

### Manual Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/btafoya/local-pm.git
cd local-pm
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your MongoDB connection string
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## MCP Server Setup

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server allows AI assistants like Claude to interact with your project management data directly.

### Building the MCP Server

```bash
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
```

### Adding to Claude Code (Global)

```bash
claude mcp add --scope user local-pm node "/path/to/local-pm/mcp-server/dist/index.js"
```

### Adding to Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop config (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "local-pm": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/local-pm/mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "LOCAL_PM_URL": "http://localhost:3010"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## How MCP Enhances AI Development

### What is MCP?

Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to interact with external tools and data sources. Instead of just chatting, AI can take actions in the real world through well-defined tool interfaces.

### Benefits for AI-Assisted Development

1. **Persistent Task Tracking**
   - AI can create tickets for features it's implementing
   - Track progress across coding sessions
   - Never lose context on what was done or what's pending

2. **Structured Workflow**
   - AI breaks down complex features into subtasks
   - Sets priorities and due dates
   - Manages dependencies between tickets

3. **Project Organization**
   - AI can organize work into logical projects
   - Assign tasks to teams
   - Maintain a clear overview of all work

4. **Seamless Integration**
   - Works directly in your AI coding workflow
   - No context switching to external tools
   - AI reads and updates tickets as it works

### Example Workflow

```
You: "Create a project for our new authentication system"

AI: [Creates project AUTH with relevant description]

You: "Break down the login feature into tickets"

AI: [Creates tickets for:
  - AUTH-1: Implement login form UI
  - AUTH-2: Create authentication API endpoint
  - AUTH-3: Add JWT token handling
  - AUTH-4: Implement session management
  Sets AUTH-2 as blocking AUTH-3 and AUTH-4]

You: "Start working on the login form"

AI: [Moves AUTH-1 to In Progress, implements the feature,
     then moves to Done when complete]
```

### Why Local & Self-Hosted?

- **Privacy**: Your project data stays on your machine
- **Speed**: No network latency for AI tool calls
- **Control**: Customize and extend as needed
- **Offline**: Works without internet connection

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Payload CMS 3.0
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **MCP Server**: TypeScript, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
